This submenu contains commands that run example
JavaScript scripts located in the folder at:

   ImageJ/plugins/Examples/_Scripts

To run JavaScript, ImageJ uses the Mozilla Rhino
interpreter that is built into Java 1.6 and later.

To run a script, download it, drag and drop it on the 
"ImageJ" window, then press ctrl-r (Macros>Run Macro).
Or copy it the clipboard, press shift+v (File>New>System Clipboard),
then press ctrl+j (Macros>Evaluate JavaScript).

More information is available at

Example scripts are available on the ImageJ website at
