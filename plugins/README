1 Getting Started
The Java Development Kit (JDK) version 1.6 is required for writing new plugins.
Make sure a copy of Sample.java.sample is available in this directory for an
example of a stubbed-out plugin.  To create a new plugin, copy the sample file
to a new file with a name of your choice, according to the Java Language 
Specification section 3.8 (the name must start with: 1: An uppercase letter, 
2: A lowercase letter, 3: an underscore (_), or 4: a dollar sign ($), the name 
can then continue with any of the above and/or digits).  Inside the file, the 
name of the class NEEDS to match the name of the file (e.g. Sample.java ->
public class Sample extends ECGFile { ... }).

2 Necessary Methods
For the proper operation of the plugin, 4 methods need implementation: read(),
getSampleInterval(), getLayout(), and getExtension().

2.1 read()
This is the main function of the class.  This function takes in a filename and
outputs the data in that file as well as a success flag.  The filename is a 
standard Java String representing an absolute path to the file.
