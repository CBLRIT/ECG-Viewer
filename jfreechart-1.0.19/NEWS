JFreeChart 1.0.13
-----------------
20 April 2009

******************************************************************************
* SPECIAL NOTICE:  There will be a birds-of-a-feather session for JFreeChart *
* at this year's JavaOne conference in San Francisco.  The session is        *
* scheduled for 6.45pm to 7.35pm on Wednesday 3 June.                        *
******************************************************************************

This release contains:

- updates to the ChartPanel class to support copying charts to the clipboard, 
  panning and mouse-wheel zooming, and an overlay mechanism that supports
  crosshairs;
- enhancements to the auto-range calculation for axes, providing the ability
  to use subranges only and also to skip hidden series;
- updates for many of the CategoryItemRenderer implementations to ensure that
  they respect the 'seriesVisible' flags;
- an improvement to the TimeSeries class so that it is no longer necessary to
  specify the time period type in the constructor;
- a new SamplingXYLineRenderer for improving the performance of time series
  charts with large datasets;
- the XYSeries/XYSeriesCollection classes now cache the minimum and maximum
  data values to improve the performance of charts with large datasets;
- entities are now created for the chart, data area and axes, allowing mouse
  clicks to be detected for these regions;
- added a bar alignment factor to the XYBarRenderer class;
- a new 'errorIndicatorStroke' field for the StatisticalLineAndShapeRenderer 
  and XYErrorRenderer classes;
- added a new HeatMapDataset interface, DefaultHeatMapDataset implementation,
  and a HeatMapUtilities class to make it easier to create heat map charts;
- there is a new flag to allow an XYDataImageAnnotation to be included in the
  automatic range calculation for the axes;
- additional attributes in the XYTextAnnotation class;
- added a sampleFunction2DToSeries() method to the DatasetUtilities class;
- some changes to the ChartPanel class that help to work around a regression in
  JRE 1.6.0_10 relating to drawing in XOR mode.  Regarding this final point:
     * the default value for the useBuffer flag has changed to true, which means
       that all charts will, by default, be rendered into an off-screen image
       before being displayed in the ChartPanel;
     * the zoom rectangle is drawn using XOR mode *only* when the useBuffer
       flag has been set to false.
  For most usage, this should improve performance (but at the cost of using more
  memory for each ChartPanel used in your application);

Bug Fixes:

2690293 : Problem with Javascript escape characters;
2617557 : StandardDialScale ignored tickLabelPaint;
2612649 : Stroke selection in plot property editor;
2583891 : SWTGraphics2D.fillPolygon() not implemented;
2564636 : Month constructor ignores Locale;
2502355 : ChartPanel sending multiple events;
2490803 : PeriodAxis.setRange() method doesn't take into account that the axis
          displays whole periods;

In addition, a bug in the SlidingCategoryDataset class has been fixed, the
correct outline paint is now used by GradientXYBarPainter, a new method
has been added to the ImageMapUtilities class to escape special characters
in Javascript strings to avoid problems with the OverLIB and DynamicDrive
tooltips, and there are some important fixes in the LogAxis class.

This release passes 2110 JUnit tests (0 failures) on JRE 1.6.0_12.


JFreeChart 1.0.12

attributes in the XYBubbleRenderer, and potential NullPointerExceptions in the
ChartPanel class.


JFreeChart 1.0.2:
-----------------
Released on 25 August 2006.

API adjustments:

The following adjustments have been made to the API (there should be no 
breakage of applications coded to the 1.0.0 or 1.0.1 API):

- CategoryToPieDataset: added accessor methods for underlying dataset, extract
    type and index (feature request 1477915);
- DefaultXYDataset:  New dataset implementation that uses double[] arrays;

    aggregatedItemsPaint, plus accessor methods - see bug 1190647;
- SpiderWebPlot:  Added new fields toolTipGenerator and urlGenerator, plus 
    accessor methods (see patch 1463455);

- XYPolygonAnnotation: Added new accessor methods.

Patches:

1459313 - Add renderAsPercentages option to StackedBarRenderer3D;
1462727 - Modify SpiderWebPlot to support zero values;

  XYStepAreaRenderer and TimeSeriesURLGenerator to call dataset methods that 
  return double primitive only;
- Updated XYPolygonAnnotation, adding new accessor methods and fixing problems
  in the equals()/hashCode() methods;
- ChartFactory.createStackedXYAreaChart() now uses StackedXYAreaRenderer2, for
  better handling of negative values;
- Added crosshair support for XYBarRenderer.

Experimental Code:

In this release, some new (incomplete) classes have been included in the 
org.jfree.experimental.* namespace.  These classes are not part of the 
standard API, but are included for developers to experiment with and provide
feedback on.  Hopefully in the future, refined versions of these classes will
be incorporated into the main library.  PLEASE NOTE THAT THE API FOR THESE
CLASSES IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE. 


JFreeChart 1.0.1:
----------------
Released 27 January 2006.  This is primarily a bug fix release.  In addition,
there are some API adjustments (there should be no breakage of applications 
coded to the 1.0.0 API).

API adjustments:
- BarRenderer: added a new flag (includeBaseInRange), plus accessor 
    methods, that controls whether or not the base value for the bar is 
    included in the range calculated by the findRangeBounds() method;
- BubbleXYItemLabelGenerator: new class;
- Range: added a new method expandToInclude(Range, double), this is used by 
    the BarRenderer class;
- TaskSeriesCollection: added two new methods, getSeries(int) and 
    getSeries(Comparable).
- TimeSeriesCollection:  the domainIsPointsInTime flag has been deprecated.  
    The flag serves no function now that renderers are used to calculate the 
    domain bounds, so you can safely delete any calls to the
    setDomainIsPointsInTime() method;
- XYPlot: added a new getAnnotations() method;
- XYSeries: the update(int, Number) method has been deprecated and a new method
    updateByIndex(int, Number) has been added;

Bug fixes:

1243050 - XYBarRenderer doesn't show entire range of values for a 
          TimeSeriesCollection;
1373371 - XYBubbleRenderer doesn't support item labels;
1374222 - BarRenderer contains JDK 1.4 specific code;
1374328 - LegendItem serialization problem;
1377239 - Bad argument checking in Quarter constructor;
1379331 - Incorrect drawing of TextTitle at LEFT or RIGHT position;
1386328 - RingPlot entity incorrect;
1400442 - Inconsistent treatment of null and zero values in PiePlot;
1401856 - Bad rendering for non-zero base values in BarRenderer;
1403043 - NullPointerException in CategoryAxis;
1408904 - NumberAxis3D assumes CategoryPlot;
1415480 - XYTextAnnotation equals() method doesn't check (x, y);
