/**
 * Transforms a <code>GradientPaint</code> to range over the width of a target 
 * shape.  The orientation of the resulting <code>GradientPaint</code>
 * depend on the coordinates of the original paint:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li> If the original paint starts at 0,0 and ends at a point 0, y != 0,
 * the resulting paint will have a vertical orientation.
 * <li> If the original paint starts at 0,0 and ends at a point x !=0, 0,
 * the resulting paint will have a horizontal orientation.
 * <li> If the original paint starts at 0,0 and ends at a point x != 0, y != 0,
 * the resulting paint will have a diagonal orientation from the upper left to
 * the lower right edge. Lines of equal color will have a 45 ∞ angle,
 * pointing upwards from left to right.
 * <li> If the original paint starts at a point x != 0, y != 0,
 * the resulting paint will have a diagonal orientation from the lower left to
 * the upper right edge. Lines of equal color will have a 45 ∞ angle,
 * pointing downwards from left to right.
 * </ul>
 * <p>In all cases, the cyclic flag of the original paint will be taken into 
 * account.</p>
