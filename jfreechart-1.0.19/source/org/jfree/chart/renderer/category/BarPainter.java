 * The interface for plugin painter for the {@link BarRenderer} class.  When
 * developing a class that implements this interface, bear in mind the
 * following:
 * <ul>
 * <li>the <code>equals(Object)</code> method should be overridden;</li>
 * <li>instances of the class should be immutable OR implement the
 *     <code>PublicCloneable</code> interface, so that a renderer using the
 *     painter can be cloned reliably;
 * <li>the class should be <code>Serializable</code>, otherwise chart
 *     serialization will not be supported.</li>
